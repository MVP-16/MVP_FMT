<h1>Electrónica</h1>
<h4>Arduino Mega</h4>
It is used for projects that require a greater number of pins. These are its technical characteristics: Microcontroller: ATMega2560. Clock speed: 16 MHz.

<h4>H Bridge</h4>
The H-bridge for single-phase motors uses four transistors to control the direction of current flowing through the motor. For the motor to rotate forward or reverse, only two transistors can be turned on at a time.

 <h4>Shield V2</h4>
The Arduino Sensor Shield V2.0 allows direct connection to an Arduino Mega board and facilitates the connection of different modules, such as sensors, relays, servos, buttons, potentiometers and more.

<h4>Ultrasonic sensor</h4>
As the name implies, ultrasonic sensors measure distance by using ultrasonic waves. The head emits an ultrasonic wave and receives the reflected wave returning from the object. Ultrasonic sensors measure the distance to the object by counting the time between emission and reception.
<h4>Servomotor</h4>
A servomotor is a closed-loop servomechanism that uses position feedback to control its rotational speed and position.” Thus, a servomotor is designed to control the movement of its axis in terms of speed, acceleration, torque and position.

<h4>DC wheels</h4>
It is a device that rotates on its own axis and is used to transport loads from one place to another and to perform various tasks on various machines.

<h4>Yellow gear motors</h4>
The Yellow Gear Motor for Cart and compatible for Arduino projects is an electromechanical device that allows you to reduce the speed at a high torque. Excellent traction on a wide variety of surfaces, these dual-axis gearmotors are available with a 48:1 and 120:1 gearbox.

<h4>Pixy2 Cam </h4>
The Pixy 2.0 is an image sensor with a powerful processor that can be programmed to send only the information you are looking for, exporting information via UART, SPI, I2C, digital out, or analog serial port. The Pixy 2.0 can also be used to identify hue and saturation of images.
<h4>Jumpers</h4>
They are used to build interconnection links and allow connectivity at high speed and bandwidth, so they are cables with connectors (SC, LC, FC or whatever your network requires) at both ends.

<h4>Batteries </h4>
The term battery refers to an electrochemical energy store, which gathers and discharges energy thanks to reversible chemical reactions that facilitate the charging of equipment through electrical sources.

<h4>Battery clip </h4>
Clip-on battery holder that allows you to connect the 9 V square battery. It is mainly used in connection boards (Protoboard) or to power any electronic circuit prototype that meets the specifications mentioned below.
