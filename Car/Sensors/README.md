<h3>Ultrasonic sensor</h3>
The use of HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors allows us, especially for the initial run, to detect distances to walls in the vicinity of the vehicle. They emit ultrasonic waves and measure distance through the time it takes for the reflected signal to return.
This is decisive to avoid collisions with walls and drive safely around turns. They can be placed in different directions and angles to cover a wide field of vision.
