<h1>Development</h1>
<p>The model of our vehicle was planned, that is, the chassis, since it had to be functional and it was necessary to add a turning axis that was as functional as possible, given that we have a limit measurement for it. The structure is as follows:</p>

</p>

<p>Then we had to think of a type of steering mechanism at the front so that it could turn without any problem. This works through a servomotor which makes it turn from an angle of 90 degrees to 0 degrees and reverses to be able to dodge. and make the turn. The following image shows its structure.</p>

</p>

The structure of our front axle is very efficient since it has two small tires, three transparent acrylic bases, screws, nuts, a servomotor and other components, which use the rotation and movement of our vehicle.
 the turning radius and the possibility of colliding with obstacles.

 <br>
As we progressed we had to add more components such as a Pixy2 Cam, change from an Arduino Uno to an Arduino Mega and a shield v2 for the connection pins since they were not enough for all the components, in addition to adding more sensors sonics since in the turn it was not able to instantly detect the bases of the track, the programming process was quite arduous, as components and sensors were added, lines of code had to be modified and added.</br>
