 #MVP_FMT World Final Turkey 2024

<h1>Introduction</h1>
This is our GitHub repository which is an autonomous driving vehicle from <b>Team MVP </b> for the competition at WRO Future Engineers 2024 in Izmir Turkey. In this repository, we analyze and show our process of planning and building our vehicle. We describe our problems and ideas along the way and explain our construction plans and schedules.

<h1>General Description</h1>
Our car is powered by an Arduino Mega. It contains a chassis in which our entire project is assembled. The energy is supplied by four rechargeable batteries, it consists of 3 ultrasonic sensors, which send the information that is being detected, that is, the distance from the walls, it sends the information to the Arduino and it responds depending on the programming code as well as to the sensors. from which it sends the information to the car.

<h1>Description</h1>
Our prototype is a cart that works based on programming which is designed so that the vehicle does not crash and avoids obstacles through an ultrasonic sensor that measures the distance through sound waves that come out through the thrig and enter through the echo giving a signal to the Arduino mega to command the servomotor to detect the programmed distance to turn to the right, thus allowing the sonic sensor to take a reading again which, if it is appropriate to the programmed one, will cause the front axle or servomotor to rotate. towards the right. This also has a Pixy2 cam that when detecting a color will be an action given in the competition guidelines.

<h1>Development/h1>
In development we provide general information about our development vehicle with the ideas we had during the process, the problems we faced and how we solved them.
 
<h1>Structure</h1>
Shows the structure of the vehicle and its tools.
<h1>Programming</h1>
In programming we explain the important part of coding. We describe and explain our structure, the decision to use C++, as well as our actual General program.
<h1>Vehicle </h1>
The vehicle part shows our car, the components of the car, how they are assembled. In electronics we explain the wiring and power supplies for the motors and sensors as well as the motors with which the car is equipped. In addition, the sensors we use, their special characteristics and their purposes are explained.

<h1>Photos</h1>
In the images there are photos of the car from different angles as well as our team photo.

<h1>Videos </h1>
The YouTube videos demonstrate the performance of our vehicle on the track.

<h1>Sources</h1>
In the sources we document our sources of information, in addition, all our purchases are stored.
